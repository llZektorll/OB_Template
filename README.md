# What is Obsidian?
<details>
<summary></summary>

**The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.**

**In Obsidian, making and following connections is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph.**

# Project Description
<details>
<summary></summary>

OB_Templates is a <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> reference for my note templates. 

I have crafted these templates for my personal use, as such they are tailored made for my needs.
In any case I decided to share them since most of them have been created based on other people templates, my OneNote, work notes and years of note taking.

I have converted coffee into this repository. If you thinks it was worth it consider helping me buy more coffee<a href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/llzektorll"> PayPal </a>

# Usage
<details>
<summary></summary>

OB_Templates it's not a vault template, this is simply a folder of templates to be added in your vault. 

You can add the templates to your vault in different ways, there are some of me easiest examples.

1. Download the repository, extract the files and add to your vault.
2. Go to a specific template and copy the text (Make sure you open in raw mode) and copy the text to a file in your vault.

<summary></summary>

	❓ - How do i add the templates ?

A: Simply copy the templates folder or the specific template file to your vault.

	❓ - How do I use the templates ?

A: As a general rule, most templates need to be "Imported". In other words, make sure you have at least Obsidian native templates option enabled and configured.

	❓ - Can i clone the repository?

# File Structure
<details>
<summary></summary>

This file structure is designed to fit my need, I will leave a brief explanation on how it works.

1. All folder start with "0" followed by a letter Since this is my main note system it's value is 0, the letter determines the folder main branch.
EX: 0A_Template. "0" -> Root notes folder "A" -> First vault folder "Templates" -> Main type of information

2. All the files carry the information from it's hierarchy.
EX: 0A_1_1_DailyLog, "0" -> Root notes folder "A" -> First vault folder "1" -> first folder in the vault "1" -> First Sub-folder "DailyLog" -> File Name
